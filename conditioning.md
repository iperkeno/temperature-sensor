# Temperature Sensors - Conditioning




## Analog Devices
 
ADCs AD7793 (or AD7713) are 24 bit sigma delta ADC which also provides the excitation and signal conditioning for sensors such as RTDs. 
It is a complete analog front end for low frequency measurement applications. So there is no direct successor to the ADT70 as the type of functionality provided by this device can now be typically built into the ADC.
