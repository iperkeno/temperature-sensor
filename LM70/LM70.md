### Description

The host can query the LM70 at any time to read temperature. A shutdown mode decreases power consumption to less than 10 µA. This mode is useful in systems where low average power consumption is critical.

The LM70 has 10-bit plus sign temperature resolution (0.25°C per LSB) while operating over a temperature range of −55°C to +150°C. 

The LM70's 2.65V to 5.5V supply voltage range, low supply current and simple SPI interface make it ideal for a wide range of applications. These include thermal management and protection applications in hard disk drives, printers, electronic test equipment, and office electronics.
