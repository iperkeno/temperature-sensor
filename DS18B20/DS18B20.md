The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an alarm function with nonvolatile user-programmable upper
and lower trigger points. 
The DS18B20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus that by definition requires only one
data line (and ground) for communication with a central microprocessor. In addition, the DS18B20 can derive power directly from the data line (“parasite power”),
eliminating the need for an external power supply.
Each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which allows multiple DS18B20s to function on the same 1-Wire bus. Thus, it is simple to use one microprocessor to
control many DS18B20s distributed over a large area.
Applications that can benefit from this feature include HVAC environmental controls, temperature monitoring systems inside buildings, equipment, or
